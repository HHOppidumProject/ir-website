        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>One cannot help but stare in awe at the vastness and majesty of the ocean. It is the domain of Neptune, God of the Seas. Originally of minor prominence and with a greater potential emphasis on equestrianism, following Greek influence and an increase in maritime spread, Neptune quickly came to be revered as the lord of the oceans and god of the seas.</p>

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>Scholars heavily debate the origins of Neptune. It is generally accepted he was initially revered as some type of water divinity, but in what context is unclear. If he is Proto-Indo-European, he is unlikely to have an oceanic domain, as the Proto-Indo-Europeans had little knowledge of the sea. Speculations about his original form include a role primarily as a fertility god, a weather deity, an agriculture god, a river god, the list goes on. Etymologies broadly list his name as deriving from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning 'to dampen', but even this is highly contested.</p>
        <p>His Greek variant Poseidon is equally perplexing. He appears to lack a cognate among the Proto-Indo-Europeans in both function and etymology. No convincing explanation of his place of origin has been offered, with speculations dotting the map of the Hellenistic world. Regardless of his beginnings, his arrival in Italy achieved popularity by becoming syncretized with the indigenous Neptune, giving Neptune a newfound prominence among the Roman people.</p>

        <h2>Mythology and Legends</h2>
        <p>Early in Rome's history, there was an influx of population as refugees began to number the city's ranks, yet their population had a surplus of men and few women. Neptune, under the epithet Consus, is said to have advised Romulus in ordering the abduction of women from the nearby Sabine peoples. Under the guise of a banquet, Romulus invited the Sabine folk and, upon a signal, had his men seize the women. The Sabine men, understandably outraged, declared war on the Romans, leading to an eventual peace treaty when the abducted women intervened. The Romans and Sabines unified as a people, introducing their own gods and rites to the young Roman state.</p>

        <h2>In Ancient Rome</h2>
        <p>An annual festival of Neptune is recorded, known as the Neptunalia, held every July 23rd. However, due to the extreme age and archaic role f the festival, the exact nature of it is unclear, with little certain except that people would build huts out of sticks and leaves to mark the occasion.</p>
        <p>Following a pattern of obscurity, the flamen priesthoods date among the oldest in Rome, with twelve minor flamens known to have existed. However, only ten are directly attested. Some scholars have theorized that Neptune numbered among the remaining two. Which, if true, would indicate a level of esteem (in some capacity) even among the very early Romans, but a lack of direct evidence makes this impossible to verify.</p>
